Our family household includes myself, my wife, our two children, and my wife’s parents, who live with us permanently. As a result, we are responsible for supporting not only our children’s education but also the medical and daily expenses of my in-laws. My mother-in-law is diabetic and requires regular insulin and ongoing medical care, which adds a significant and continuous expense.
Along with these medical costs, we also manage the school fees and educational needs of both of our children, which further adds to our responsibilities. In India, there is no system of need-based financial support available for families in such circumstances, so everything is managed from our family’s income alone.
While we are committed to providing our children with the best possible education, receiving financial aid would greatly ease the pressure on our family. It would allow our daughter to pursue the IB Diploma Programme at The Global College with full focus and without financial strain limiting her opportunities.
